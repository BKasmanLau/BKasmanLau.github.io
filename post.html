              <h1>Preface</h1>
              
              <p>G'day, my name is Brandon Kasman Lau. I'm 19 years old and this is my fitness journey from the beginning until now. Let me preface that I do not reccomend others to use the methods that I have in changing my body compesistion as they are extreme and may have an effect on future health.</p>
              
              <h2 class="section-heading">Act I: Rough Beginnings</h2>
              
              <p>I never really cared about the nutrition or going to the gym a couple of years ago. I never payed attention to all the junk that I ate. The picture below depicts this very clearly. I didn't have any motivation, goals or discipline. 
              
                </p>
                <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/skinny.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
               
            
              <span class="caption text-muted">72kg, 17% Bodyfat. Circa December 2016 </span>
              
              
            <blockquote>I was diagnosed with a common disease called fuckerounditis.</blockquote>

            <p>At the time I played rugby and tennis but I wasn't necessarily good at either of these sports. I started my fitness journey doing calisthenics (bodyweight excercises) and although I made some progress and made marginal changes to my physique, I wasn't really happy with my progress, I wasn't exactly ripped or considered fit. To be honest, I had no reason for doing fitness. I had a major case of fuckerounditis.</p>

            <p>In my sophmore year of highschool, my rugby coach told me I had potential to play for the varsity team. However, in order to qualify for my position (Prop) I had to change my body composition and meet certain strength goals. So then I had a goal, put on a shitload of weight and make strength progress in the gym</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Act II: The Thiccening</h2>
                
                <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/BULK.JPG" alt="">
            </a>
              <span class="caption text-muted">90kg, 23% Bodyfat. Circa June 2017 </span>
              
              
            
           <blockquote> With a goal requires a plan but more importantly perfect execution.</blockquote>
              
            <p>My plan was to gain 40 pounds within a 6 month time frame and along with that increase my bench press to 120kg, squat to 140kg and deadlift to 180kg. To execute this plan I ate 4000 calories and used a 5x5 strength based program.</p>

            <p>In hindsight this wasn't really a good plan, 40 pounds within a 6 month time span is excessive and the fat gain wasn't optimal for general health or cardiovascular performance</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, I achieved my weight and strength goals within this short time frame. After pasing the strength and skills test, I became a starting player on the Varsity Rugby team and my season was amazing to say the least until I got injured.</p>
            
              <h2 class="section-heading">Act III: Coming out of hibernation</h2>
                
              
              <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/80.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
               <span class="caption text-muted">80kg, 17% Bodyfat. Circa December 2017  </span>
              
              <p>After a long rugby season I decided that enough was enough, I needed to lose the weight I gained over the year. Over 6 months I lost 10kg using a no-carb diet. Since I was at such a high body fat the dieting wasn't a problem for me. I shedded the fat like crazy</p>
              
              
            <h2 class="section-heading">Act IV: Shredz </h2>
              
    
              
              <div>
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SHredz.JPG" alt="">
            </a>
              
            
            <span class="caption text-muted">72kg, 13% Bodyfat. Circa September 2018  </span>
              </div>  
                
            <p>Now getting to this level of bodyfat was a challenge for me. It required an immaculate and consistent diet. Not to say that I didn't have the occasional cheat day :). As we approach December, I have started a lean bulk aiming to hit 81kg by next may. Goal is to maximise muscle gain whilst minimizing fat gains.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Final Words</h2>
            
            <p>Take this journey with a grain of salt. Don't replicate what I did in terms of weight gain because the efficiency of my gains was subpar to say the least.
